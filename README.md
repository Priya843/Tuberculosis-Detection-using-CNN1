<h1>Tuberculosis Detection Using Deep Learning</h1>
<hr>
<p>This project focuses on developing and evaluating a deep learning model to detect tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images. The model leverages pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images and assist in TB diagnosis.</p>
